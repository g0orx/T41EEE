### Version T41EEE.1 T41 Software Defined Transceiver Arduino Sketch

This is the "T41 Extreme Experimenter's Edition" software for the 
T41 Software Defined Transceiver.  The T41EEE was "forked" from the V049.2 version
of the T41-EP software.  T41EEE is fundamentally different from the mainstream T41-EP
code in that it adopts C++ rather than C.  C++ language features will be gradually
introduced in the next releases.

T41EEE will be hosted at this public Github repository:

<https://github.com/Greg-R/T41EEE>

I don't plan on publishing periodic releases.  The repository will be updated as bug fixes
and feature enhancements become available.  You will be able to update and FLASH your radio
with the revised software quickly.

Please note that the configuration structure is different than the predecessor V049.2
It is recommended to perform a full FLASH erase before loading T41EEE.1.

You will need to install the ArduinoJSON library by Benoit Blanchon.  Using the IDE:
Tools -> Manage Libraries ...
Search for ArduinoJSON.  Note this is a single word, as there is another library
with the name Arduino_JSON, which is not the correct library.  Install the library,
and if you have the other dependencies for the V049.2 version, compilation will be
successful.

## Highlight of Features included in T41EEE.1

Thank you to Jonathan KN6LFB for the major improvement in button functionality!

1.  Switch matrix buttons are changed from polling to interrupts for improved performance.
2.  The new button code includes a tunable variable for button response time.  This variable
    is added to the calibration menu as BTN REPEAT.  The default value should be a good
    starting point.  If button response is too fast, increase the BTN REPEAT value.
3.  The switch matrix calibration routine is added to the calibration menu.
4.  Switch matrix calibration is easier and precise.  It is possible to push a button
    and hold it.  It will not skip to the next button.  In practice, a short, firm push
    on each button in the proper series will rapidly complete the process.
5.  EEPROM start-up code is significantly revised.

## Additions by John Melton G0ORX

1.  Support for G0ORX MCP23017 Front Panel.
2.  Support for G0ORX RPi Pico Front Panel.
3.  Subset of Kenwood TS-2000 CAT Interface over USB Serial port.
4.  Display simple Audio display when transmitting.
5.  VFO - User1 copy VFO-A to VFO-B. User2 copy VFO-B to VFO-A
6.  Tune Encoder switch - change between VFO-A and VFO-B.
7.  Volume Encoder Switch - change encoder function between Volume, Mic Gain, AGC Gain, Sidetone Volume and Noise Floor level.
8.  Filter Encoder Switch - rotate through AGC Modes
9.  Fine Tune Encoder Switch - swap VFO-A and VFO-B
